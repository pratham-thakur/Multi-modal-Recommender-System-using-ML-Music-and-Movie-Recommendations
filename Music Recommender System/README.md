 # Music Recommendation System Using Machine Learning (ML):

## Key Features:
***1-Music Recommender System:*** Utilizing cutting-edge vectorization and cosine similarity techniques, the music recommendation engine analyses users' listening habits, preferences, and historical data to generate highly relevant music suggestions. Users can discover new artists, albums, and tracks that align with their musical taste.

***2-Vectorization and Cosine Similarity:*** Both recommendation systems rely on the power of vectorization to represent user preferences and items in a high-dimensional space. Cosine similarity is then used to compute the similarity between vectors, enabling the systems to identify items that are closely related to users' preferences.

***3-Streamlit Front-end:*** The project includes an interactive and user-friendly front-end interface developed using the Streamlit library. Users can easily interact with the recommendation systems, input their preferences, and receive real-time suggestions for music and movies that cater to their tastes.
