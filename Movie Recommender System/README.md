 # Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning (ML):

## Key Features:
***1-Movie Recommender System: The movie recommendation engine employs similar state-of-the-art techniques to process users' viewing history, genre preferences, and other relevant factors to deliver tailored movie recommendations. Users can explore a curated list of films that match their cinematic interests.***

***2-Vectorization and Cosine Similarity:*** Both recommendation systems rely on the power of vectorization to represent user preferences and items in a high-dimensional space. Cosine similarity is then used to compute the similarity between vectors, enabling the systems to identify items that are closely related to users' preferences.

***3-Streamlit Front-end:*** The project includes an interactive and user-friendly front-end interface developed using the Streamlit library. Users can easily interact with the recommendation systems, input their preferences, and receive real-time suggestions for music and movies that cater to their tastes.
